It can be achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.On the other hand,Encapsulation refers to bundling an object's data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (the object) and restricting direct access to some of its components to protect the data from unintended interference or misuse.Encapsulation is about controlling access to the object's internal state using access modifiers (like private,public,protected) and providing controlled access via getter and setter methods."
